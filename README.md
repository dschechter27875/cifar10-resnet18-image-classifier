# Project Overview

This project builds and compares two deep learning architectures for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

• A **baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
• A **ResNet-18 architecture**

The goal is to explore how deeper residual architectures improve performance and training stability compared to standard CNNs.

The models were trained and evaluated using PyTorch with GPU acceleration.

This model serves as a **baseline computer vision classifier**.

## ResNet-18

ResNet introduces **residual connections**, allowing deeper networks to train effectively.

Instead of learning:

```
H(x)
```

the network learns a residual:

```
F(x) = H(x) − x
```

which improves gradient flow during backpropagation.

# Example Model Predictions

![ResNet Predictions](resnet_predictions.png)

These predictions highlight both correct classifications and failure cases.

Typical mistakes occur between visually similar classes:

```
cat ↔ dog
deer ↔ horse
automobile ↔ truck
```

This is expected due to the small resolution (32×32).

---

# Results

ResNet-18 significantly improves classification performance compared to the baseline CNN.

Reasons include:

• deeper feature extraction  
• residual connections improving gradient flow  
• stronger hierarchical representations  

ResNet is able to better capture complex spatial patterns in images.
